### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by! Please take a look at my pinned projects, particularly AulysEngine, the scratch-clone written in Haskell, and certainpy in Python3!

#### About me

I'm currently wrapping up my final year of Computer Science at the brilliant University of Warwick.

On the technical front, my interests are quite broad - most topics in software engineering are interesting once you get your hands dirty with them.

I really enjoy programming, but often this field can be lonely - I encourage you to contribute/ping me regarding any of my projects, or yours!

#### I'm looking to collaborate on...

- Heterogeneous computing, compiler toolchains or particular compiler steps (e.g. optimization, adapting compilers to new platforms, etc)
- Reconfigurable computing from a software perspective. Maybe a kernel module that improves discoverability/usability of blocks loaded on an FPGA?
- Network/packet filtering, on networks cards/FPGAs/in the kernel with BPF. More software-defined networking!
- Games & engines.
- Pen support for Emacs? I'd really like to scribble and jot down notes on top of my org files.
 
#### I'm interested in learning...

- More about UVM, or RTL verification/modelling more broadly.
- A bit about embedded/low-level tooling, such as Yocto, bitbake, and RTOS's.
- I'd like to try some of the newer languages around, such as Jai, Nim, Zig...
